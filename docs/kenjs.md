KenJs is a Javascript library to process KenML and interpet Ken knowledge graphs. Most of the codebase is written in [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io), but it is accessible via Javascript. The codebase is in a monorepo, [here](https://github.com/kenstandard/ken-js/tree/master/packages/ken-js).
